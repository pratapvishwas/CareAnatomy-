# Introduction
Care Anatomy is the mental health care website that provides services for people who need support with their mental health or want to understand more about their mental health well-being. This online service is free of charge, but customers can pay a premium to get additional and special treatment. Also, there is a donation system on the website that allows people to donate money for the benefit of the project and people with mental health illness. Since we are in the pandemic (COVID-19), we will have special service available during the tough time.
